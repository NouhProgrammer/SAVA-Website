  <h2>Beginner Aviation Courses</h2>
    <p>
      We provide ATC and aircraft specific courses for beginners on VATSIM.

      If you are a beginner and need something more than youtube tutorials; need someone to teach you one-on-one, our courses are the perfect for you.

      They are free and yet very helpful. We can't wait to see you with us ðŸ™ƒ.

  <h2>I'm not a beginner, why should I join?</h2>
    <p>
      Even advanced pilots can benefit from our Virtual Airline.

      Since we simulate real-world aviation, you will get just this much closer to achieving the ultimate realism without the risks, using your flight simulator of choice.
